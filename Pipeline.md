# pipeline-structural-variation

### Overview

`pipeline-structural-variation` is a pipeline for calling structural variations on whole genome sequencing data obtained from Oxford Nanopore sequencing platforms. It accepts FASTQ files and outputs aligned reads and filtered SV calls.

### Features

The pipeline performs the following steps:
- Maps reads using minimap2
- Produces QC report using NanoPlot
- Estimates appropriate parameters for variant calling depending on read depth
- Calls variants using sniffles
- Filters variants by minimum/maximum length, read support, or type (e.g. insertion, deletion, etc.)

******************
# Getting Started

### Requirements
The following software packages must be installed prior to running:

-  [miniconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) - please refer to installation [instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

### Installation
After installing miniconda3 and snakemake (see above), install the pipeline as follows:
```bash
# Get pipeline
$ wget -O pipeline-structural-variation.tar.gz https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-structural-variation/archive/v1.6.1.tar.gz
# Unzip
$ tar xvzf pipeline-structural-variation.tar.gz
# Change to directory
$ cd pipeline-structural-variation-*
# Create conda environment with all dependencies
$ conda env create -n pipeline-structural-variation -f env.yml
# Activate environment
$ conda activate pipeline-structural-variation
# To test if the installation was successful run
$ snakemake -p all
# Deactivate environment
$ conda deactivate
```

### Input

To run the pipeline the following input files are required:

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Reference genome | FASTA file containing the reference genome (e.g. GRCh38 for human) |
| Nanopore reads| Folder containing FASTQ files or a single concatenated FASTQ file. Reads should be **q-score filtered** (see FAQ)|

### Output

 The main output files created by the pipeline are:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Aligned reads | Aligned reads in indexed and sorted BAM format |
| Variant calls | Called variants in VCF format |

After the pipeline has finished you can find the aligned reads in `{output_folder}/alignment/` and the indexed and zipped VCF file in `output_folder/sv_calls/{sample_name}_sniffles_filtered.vcf`.

### Usage:

To run the pipeline with default settings invoke snakemake as follows.

```bash
$ snakemake -j 30 all --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa
```

`-j` specifies how many CPU cores will be used by the pipeline. `all` is the default target (see Targets); this will run all steps required for SV calling and produce a QC report for the input reads using NanoPlot. `input_fastq` specifies the input FASTQ files or a folder containing multiple input FASTQ files (e.g. the pass folder from MinKNOW).

### Targets

|Name| Description |
|--|--|
| all | Maps reads, calls variants and produces a QC report from the input reads |
| qc | Only maps reads and produces a QC report |
| call | Maps reads and calls variants but does not produce a QC report |
| eval | Evaluates the called variants against the GIAB truth set **only** applicable when sequencing [HG002](https://www.coriell.org/0/Sections/Search/Sample_Detail.aspx?Ref=NA24385&Product=DNA) |

### Options

The pipeline accepts several input parameters. They can either be changed in the `config.yml` (see below) file or specified when running snakemake.

For example:
```bash
snakemake -j 30 eval --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa min_sv_length=100
```
In the above example the minimum SV length parameter was changed to 100 bp.

##### Required parameters

These parameters have to be specified to run the pipeline.

| Parameter | Allowed | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| input_fastq | Absolute file path | FASTQ file or folder containing FASTQ files |
| reference_fasta | Absolute file path | FASTA file containing the reference genome |

##### Optional parameters

| Parameter | Allowed | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| sample_name | string without spaces | my_sample | Name of the sample |
| min_sv_length | Integer > 40 | 50 | Minimum SV length |
| max_sv_length | Integer | 1000000 | Maximum SV length |
| min_read_length | Integer | 1000 | Min read length. Shorter reads will be ignored |
| min_read_mapping_quality | Integer | 10 | Min mapping quality. Reads with lower mapping quality will be discarded |
| min_read_support | Integer | 'auto' | Minimum read support required to call a SV (auto for auto-detect) |

# Annotating and visualising the results

## Annotate

This step will become part of the pipeline in the future. Currently, use tools like `bedtools` or `vcfanno` to annotate the VCF file with information about genes, repeats, known SV etc. from GTF/GFF/BED files.

There are many ways to retrieve annotations. A few examples are:

-  [UCSC genome browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables)
-  [ENSEMBL](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
-  [GENCODE](https://www.gencodegenes.org/)

# Results

We benchmarked the pipeline against the preliminary [Genome in a bottle](https://jimb.stanford.edu/giab) SV truth set for HG002.

### Precision and Recall
The pipeline was run using `auto` for determining the most suitable sniffles parameters to get a good balance between precision and recall. Depending on your application you might want to change the `min_read_support` parameter to maximize either precision or recall.

| Dataset | Pipeline | Min. read support | Coverage | Precision | Recall |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------
| HG002 q7 filtered | v1.5.0 | auto | 60* | 95.86 | 95.42 |
| HG002 q7 filtered | v1.5.0 | auto | 45* | 96.04 | 94.71 |
| HG002 q7 filtered | v1.5.0 | auto | 30* | 96.44 | 92.93 |
| HG002 q7 filtered | v1.5.0 | auto | 15* | 96.72 | 87.88 |

\* Coverage was computed using mosdepth from the BAM file. The BAM file was neither filtered by mapping quality nor read length.


### Reproducing the results
Run the pipeline with HG002 data using the `eval` target. In the output folder you will find `eval/summary.txt` containing precision and recall values.

### FAQs

**I only want my results! What should I do?**
Install pipeline (see Installation) and run as follows.
```bash
$ snakemake -j 16 all --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa
```
You will find your results in the following locations:

**Aligned reads:**

```results/my_samples/alignment/my_sample_minimap2.bam```

**Variant calls:**

```results/my_samples/sv_calls/my_sample_sniffles_filtered.vcf.gz```

**What kind of structural variants are supported?**

Currently the pipeline has been validated to detect insertions, deletions and duplications from whole genome sequencing data. Support for inversions and translocations will be added in the future.

**What is the minimum SV length supported?**

Currently, 50 bp.

**How can i filter my reads by q-score?**

The most recent version of MinKNOW will perform filtering automatically. When using the FASTQ files from the `pass` output folder no additional filtering is required. For unfiltered datasets use [NanoFilt](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanofilt) with a minimum q-score of 6.

**How long will it take to run the pipeline for a 30X human dataset?**

When running with 30 CPU cores this will take roughly 6-8 hours.

**How much memory will I need?**

Memory consumption is determined by minimap2. Therefore, 16 GB will be required for human datasets. For smaller genomes 8 GB will be sufficient.

**How much storage will I need?**

Unzipped FASTQ files for a human 30X human dataset will require roughly 200 GB. In addition 150 GB will be required for the mapped BAM files.  

**Are FAST5 files required to run the pipeline?**

No.

**Can I use the pipeline to detect variants in a cancer dataset or to detect somatic variants?**

The pipeline has not yet been validated on cancer samples or for somatic variant detection.

**Can I use the pipeline to detect SVs for targeted sequencing experiments (e.g. long amplicons, etc.)?**

Calling variants in targeted regions is supported but requires the user to specify a BED file containing the coordinates of the targeted regions.

For example, save the following in a file called `targets.bed`

```
chr1 6579767 6589767
```

and run pipeline as follows:

```bash
snakemake -j 30 eval --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa target_bed=targets.bed
```
Make sure that the chromosome names in the BED file match the names in your reference FASTA files (e.g. chr1 vs. 1).

**Can I use this pipeline to detect gene fusions using DNA data?**

The current version does not support calling gene fusions from DNA data as translocation calling is not supported yet. However, support for translocations will be available in the future.

**Can I use this pipeline to detect gene fusion using cDNA data?**

cDNA data is not supported.

**Can I run the pipeline using docker?**

Yes. To build a docker image run:
```bash
$ make build
```
Next, run the pipeline as follows:
```bash
docker run -ti -w `pwd` -v `pwd`:`pwd` pipeline-structural-variation snakemake all
```
In the future we will provide a pre built docker image.
